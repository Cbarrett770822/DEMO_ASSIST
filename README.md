# WMS Tutorial Application

An interactive web application that provides tutorials on warehouse processes and demonstrates how a Warehouse Management System (WMS) can optimize these operations.

## Overview

The WMS Tutorial Application is designed to educate warehouse professionals about the benefits and implementation of Warehouse Management Systems. It provides detailed tutorials, videos, and information about key warehouse processes including receiving, putaway, inventory management, picking, packing, shipping, and returns processing.

## Features

- **Interactive Process Dashboard**: Browse and filter warehouse processes by category
- **Step-by-Step Video Tutorials**: Learn each process with guided video demonstrations
- **Benefits Analysis**: Understand the advantages of implementing a WMS for each process
- **KPI Metrics**: Learn about key performance indicators to measure success
- **Before/After Comparisons**: See how WMS transforms traditional warehouse operations

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
